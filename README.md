## How it Works

The user clicks on images of classic mustangs. Upon clicking on an image the 12 images shuffle and the user must click an image they have not already clicked. The score at top keeps track of how many images that were clicked and the high score. Upon reaching 12 clicks (the number of images) the user is notifed that they have won the game.
